Smart Irrigation System

What is Irrigation system?
     An irrigation system is nothing but supplying water to the soil and plants.  There are many ways to supply water to the plants like tubes,pumps,spray and so on.
There are many types of irrigation systems. They are
    • Drip irrigation system
    • Furrow irrigation system
    • Surface irrigation system
    • Sprinkler system ..etc.

What is smart irrigation system?
      A smart irrigation system is used to make sure that the water is supplied specifically to designated root zones whenever there is less moisture is present in the soil.
Smart irrigation system is defined based on many factors such as 
    • Soil moisture
    • Temperature
    • Humidity
    • Weather conditions
    • Type of soil
    • Type of plant
    • Water quantity from the source
    • Plant growth...etc.

Therefore the basic thing is to provide water to plants based on these factors. Using Arduino board and Several sensors, we can develop an automatic Irrigation system.

Components :
    1. Arduino Board
    2. Soil moisture sensor
    3. DHT11 sensor
    4. Rain Sensor
    5. Light sensor
    6. Motor
    7. Water pump
    8. Relay module

I have designed smart irrigation system based on 3 factors which are available in tinkercad.

Procedure:
    • Connect Moisture sensor to Arduino board and connect out pin to analog pin 1.
    • Connect temperature sensor to Arduino board connect out pin to analog pin 2.
    • Using potentiometer connect out pin to analog pin 3 in arduino board.
    • Connect to led’s [red and green] along with reistors to Digital pins 2 and 4 in arduino.
    • Connect water pump and supply of 9v to the pump.
    • Write an arduino code for the above project and upload the code
    • From this we can observe that if there is less amount of moisture in the soil, motor automatically turn on and water will be provided to the plants and red led is glown.
    • If there is good moisture in soil, green led turns on.

Benifits:

1. Water Conservation
Prevents overwatering by using real-time soil moisture data.
Uses weather predictions to adjust watering schedules.
Saves up to 50% of water compared to manual irrigation.
2. Energy Efficiency
 Reduces pump usage, saving electricity.
Automated scheduling avoids unnecessary operations.
Solar-powered options make it more eco-friendly.
3. Better Plant Health & Yield
Provides exact water needs based on soil moisture and weather.
 Prevents root rot and dry stress.
Leads to healthier crops and higher yield in agriculture.
 4. Cost Savings
Lowers water bills by using only necessary amounts.
Reduces labor costs as it works automatically.
Extends the lifespan of irrigation equipment (pumps, pipes, etc.).
5. Smart Control & Automation
Can be controlled remotely via mobile apps or IoT.
Integrates with weather data, sensors, and timers.
Works on a predefined schedule or real-time conditions.
